# CDA 5106: Advanced Computer Architecture - Fall 2023

## Overview
This repository contains my submissions for the Machine Problems assigned in the Advanced Computer Architecture course (CDA 5106) at the University of Central Florida during the Fall semester of 2023. The course is instructed by Dr. Qian Lou.

## Machine Problems
### Machine Problem 1: Cache Design, Memory Hierarchy Design
The goal of Machine Problem 1 is to implement a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator. The objective is to compare the performance, area, and energy of different memory hierarchy configurations using a subset of the SPEC-2000 benchmark suite.

### Machine Problem 2: Branch Prediction
In Machine Problem 2, the focus is on Branch Prediction. The goal is to construct a branch predictor simulator and utilize it to design branch predictors well-suited to the SPECint95 benchmarks.

## Usage
Detailed instructions and code for each machine problem can be found in their respective directories within this repository.
